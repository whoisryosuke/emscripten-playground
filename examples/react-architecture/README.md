## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

1. Download the latest release of `glm` and extract the `glm` folder inside the zip to `includes` (make sure you match import in `glm.hpp`)

### Compiling and testing WASM

1. Compile the WASM from the C++. See the script on top of the `react-architecture.cpp` file.
1. You can preview the WASM independently from React using the `index.html` and a local web server like `python -m http.server` (just run that in this folder then go to http://localhost:8000)
1. Or you can preview it inside the React app.

### Running the React App

1. Go inside `react-app`.
1. Run `npm i` to install deps.
1. Run the dev server `npm run start`
